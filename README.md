# 🌠 UJ's Teyvat - My Personal Portfolio

Welcome to the repository for my personal portfolio website. 

As a B.Tech Computer Science student and Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH) with a passion for Cybersecurity and AI, I wanted to create more than just a standard portfolio. This project showcases my skills, projects, and experiences in a unique, interactive, and Genshin Impact-themed design.

## ✨ Features
This portfolio is a single-page application (SPA) built from scratch. Here are some of its key features:

* **Thematic Design:** A complete "Genshin Impact" inspired theme with custom fonts (Josefin Sans, Quicksand), color palettes, button styles, and UI elements.

* **Hero Section:** A welcoming hero section with a custom "Teyvat" title and a dynamic, floating particle animation created with pure JavaScript.

* **About Me:** An "Adventurer's Profile" detailing my background and a "Talents" section for skills, styled as Genshin "talent tags".

* **Adventurer's Log (Projects):** A responsive grid of my top cybersecurity projects (Network Scanner, FortiPass, StegoShield), each with a "shine" hover effect.

* **Field Experience & Discoveries:** Dedicated sections for my Cisco Virtual Internship and my IEEE research paper.

* **Adventurer's Accolades:** A clean list of my key certifications (CEH, Google Cybersecurity, etc.).

* **Dark-Theme Contact Form:** A fully functional, dark-themed contact form that sends messages to my email using Formspree.

* **Responsive & Animated:** Fully responsive for mobile devices. Uses the JavaScript Intersection Observer API to trigger "animate-on-scroll" effects.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

This project was built using web fundamentals, with no major frontend framework.

* **HTML5:** For semantic structure.

* **Tailwind CSS (via CDN):** For rapid, utility-first styling and responsiveness.

* **Custom CSS3:** For all the bespoke styles, animations, theme elements (like the section divider), and dark-mode form that Tailwind doesn't cover.

* **Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+):** Used for:

  * **Mobile menu toggle**

  * **"Back to Top" button logic**

  * **Dynamic particle generation for the hero section**

  * **Intersection Observer for scroll animations**

  * **AJAX fetch request for the Formspree contact form**

* **Deployment:** Hosted on Netlify and connected directly to this GitHub repository for instant, continuous deployment.

* **Services:**

  * **Formspree for the backend-less contact form.**

  * **Google Fonts for web fonts.**

  * **Genshin Wiki for Icons.**
